## Plugin System (Under Development)

NeuroVerse introduces a **dynamic plugin framework** that allows third-party developers to create and load functionality as modular APK plugins.

* Plugins can respond to voice commands or AI-generated JSON.
* They run in a sandboxed environment with controlled permissions.
* Easily updatable and installable from a Firebase-powered Plugin Market screen.

**What can be built with plugins?**

* App launchers, automation triggers, content fetchers, accessibility-based actions, custom AI interpreters, and more.
